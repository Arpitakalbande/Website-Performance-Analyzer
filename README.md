# 🌐 Website Performance Analysis using Python | Data Science Project

This project analyzes website user behavior and traffic performance across various marketing channels using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Seaborn**. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that can help businesses improve user engagement and optimize traffic sources.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The following analytical questions are addressed:

1️⃣ What patterns or trends can be observed in website sessions and users over time?  
2️⃣ Which marketing channel brought the highest number of users to the website?  
3️⃣ Which channel has the highest average engagement time, and what does that indicate about user behavior?  
4️⃣ How does engagement rate vary across different traffic channels?  
5️⃣ Which channels drive more engaged sessions compared to non-engaged ones?  
6️⃣ At what hours of the day does each channel drive the most traffic?  
7️⃣ Is there any correlation between high traffic (sessions) and high engagement rate?

## 📊 Techniques & Visualizations Used

| Technique | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Bar Charts | Compare users by channel |
| Heatmap | Display correlation between important metrics |
| Box Plot | Understand engagement distribution |
| Time-Series Line Charts (if included) | Detect trends over time |

These visualizations provide deep understanding of traffic quality, not just volume.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Organic Social** delivered the highest number of users
- **Direct** traffic showed strong engagement behavior
- **Email / Unassigned channels** resulted in weak performance & require improvement
- User traffic peaks during the **evening hours**
- Higher traffic does not always equal better engagement 🚫

> These insights help in **optimizing marketing budgets** & improving website experience
